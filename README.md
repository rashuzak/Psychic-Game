Psychic Game

The Psychic Game is a very simple browser base game written in JavaScript game that allows you to guess the letter the computer chooses. The game is tricky and it tests the creator’s programming skills as well.

How to play:

Choose a letter from A – Z.  The computer will test your psychic ability. See if you can read a computer’s mind!

You can only choose a letter of English alphabet. If you choose a capital letter the code will convert it to small letter. If you enter a number an alert will be projected on the web browser.
